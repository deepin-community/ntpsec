This is a set of hacks for use when debugging ntpd's MS-SNTP option.

The default is off.
Use --enable-mssntp with ./waf configure to build a system with that option.

make in .../attic/samba should build them.
make clean will clean things up.

fake-samba acts like a Samba server.  It will sign packets with a constant.
That's not real authentication, but it goes through all protocol actions.
It prints a line for each packet it processes.

fake-ntp-server generates traffic for fake-samba.  It's much simpler/faster
than using ntpd to generate traffic.

fake-ntp-client generates MS-SNTP traffic for an NTP server.  If you setup
ntpd connected to fake-samba, this will generate traffic that should get
all the way to/through fake-samba and back.

fake-ntp-client needs a command line parameter: the name of the ntp server.
Optional extra paramters are the number of packets to send (default 1) and
the time to wait between packets in microseconds (default 1000).

This can also be used to generate buggy traffic to Samba.  The keyid
is unlikely to be anything Samba knows about.

It doesn't work with IPv6.

fake.h has "murray" wired in as part of the name of the UNIX socket
connecting ntpd and (fake-)samba.  "tmp" didn't work on Fedora.  Systemd
gives ntpd its own tmp directory.

Your ntp.conf will need something like this:
  ntpsigndsocket  /home/murray/fake-samba-socket
  restrict 192.168.1.2 mssntp

Note that ntpd adds "/socket" to the name from the config file.


These are simple hacks.  Look at the code and fix it to do what you want.
